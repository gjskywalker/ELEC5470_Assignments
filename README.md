## Assignment_2
Assignment 2 is about how to directly use solvers like cvxpy in python. Two implements are provided within this folder, the first one is comparison between linear regression with and without outliers, the second one is about filter design optimization.

## Assignment_4
Assignment 4 focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different convex algorithms. In folder *Problem 1*, we compared barrier method, Block Coordinate Descent, Majorization Minimization and Successive Conex Approximation's ability of minimizing LASSO (L2-L1 norm). And in folder *Problem 2*.
