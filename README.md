# Solutions for Convex Optimization Course Coding Assignments

> **Assignment 2**

* Assignment 2 is about how to directly use solvers like cvxpy in python. Two implements are provided within this folder, the first one is comparison between linear regression with and without outliers, the second one is about filter design optimization.

> **Assignment 4**

* Assignment 4 focuses on comparing the effectiveness of different convex algorithms. In folder *Problem 1*, we compared barrier method, Block Coordinate Descent, Majorization Minimization and Successive Conex Approximation's ability of minimizing LASSO (L2-L1 norm). And in folder *Problem 2*.

> **Final Project**

* To balance conservative and aggressive portfolio strategies, we build our hybrid portfolio models using a hyperparameter $\beta$ to adjust the proportion of best-case and worst-case models. Furthermore, we conduct both in-sample and out-of-sample experiments using actual stock market data to illustrate the benefits of different uncertainty and machine learning models. The in-sample experiments confirm our models' good convergence and performance, while the out-of-sample experiments demonstrate the superiority of our transformer models. The results indicate that the transformer consistently outperforms the LSTM in various market conditions, highlighting its robustness and effectiveness in portfolio management.
